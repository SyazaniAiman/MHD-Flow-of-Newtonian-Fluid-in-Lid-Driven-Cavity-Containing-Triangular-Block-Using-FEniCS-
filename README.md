# MHD-Flow-of-Newtonian-Fluid-in-Lid-Driven-Cavity-Containing-Triangular-Block-Using-FEniCS-
# Solving the Momentum Equation and Continuity Equation in order to get the velocity profile of 
# MHD flow with the differences of Uniform Magnetic Field Strength and Size of Triangular Block. 
# Used Finite Element Method implemented by Automated Solution Technique (FEniCS)
# This is programming codes to solve the Momentum equations and Continuity equations in order to get the velocity profile of
# MHD flow in lid-driven cavity containing triangular block with parameters of Uniform magnetic field and Size of triangular block.
# A Final Year Project of Muhammad Syazaniaiman Bin Mohd Shahimi suprvised by Dr Nor Raihan Binti Mohamad Asimoni under IIUM
